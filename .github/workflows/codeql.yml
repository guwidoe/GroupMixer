# CodeQL Advanced Security Scanning
#
# This workflow performs CodeQL security analysis on the codebase.
# For more information, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning
#
# Scanned languages:
#   - javascript-typescript: webapp frontend code
#   - rust: solver-core, solver-wasm, solver-server
#   - actions: GitHub workflow files
#
# Not scanned (legacy/non-production code):
#   - c-cpp (legacy_cpp/)
#   - python (python/)
