# Autoresearch: solver5 construction-heuristics coverage

## Objective
Build `solver5` as a **construction-first pure Social Golfer solver family** that routes equal-size pure-SGP `g-p-w` instances through explicit design-theoretic construction families before search is considered.

The focus in this session is **construction coverage**, not local search quality:
- accept only pure zero-repeat SGP semantics
- implement explicit constructor families and orchestration in `solver5`
- maximize how many fixed benchmark cells admit a valid zero-repeat construction, and for each `(g, p)` maximize the constructed week count `W_g,p`

The initial benchmark matrix is fixed to all cells with:
- `2 <= g <= 10`
- `2 <= p <= 10`
- pure SGP semantics only

For each cell, the benchmark searches downward from the counting upper bound
`floor((gp - 1) / (p - 1))` and records the largest `w` for which `solver5` returns a valid zero-repeat construction.

## Metrics
- **Primary**: `total_constructed_weeks` (higher is better) — sum of constructed `W_g,p` across the fixed `2..10 x 2..10` matrix.
- **Secondary**:
  - `frontier_gap_sum` (lower is better)
  - `solved_cells`
  - `exact_frontier_cells`
  - `unsolved_cells`
  - per-`p` constructed-week totals
  - per-cell `W_g_p` metrics such as `W_8_4`, `W_10_4`, `W_10_10`

## How to Run
`./autoresearch.sh`

The script:
1. runs focused `solver5` tests as a fast precheck
2. runs `backend/core/examples/solver5_construction_coverage.rs`
3. emits structured `METRIC name=value` lines
4. writes `autoresearch.last_run_metrics.json`

## Files in Scope
- `backend/core/src/solver5/**` — solver5 construction families, routing, validation, tests
- `backend/core/examples/solver5_construction_coverage.rs` — fixed construction-coverage benchmark harness
- `backend/core/src/models.rs` — solver5 params / registration
- `backend/core/src/engines/mod.rs` — solver5 engine registration
- `backend/core/src/lib.rs` — solver5 module export
- `backend/core/tests/recommended_settings.rs` — enum exhaustiveness fallout only
- `backend/wasm/src/contract_projection.rs` — solver catalog projection fallout only
- `tools/autoresearch/solver5-construction/**`
- `autoresearch.md`
- `autoresearch.sh`
- `autoresearch.checks.sh`
- `autoresearch.ideas.md`
- `construction_heuristics_research.md`

## Off Limits
- changing the benchmark matrix definition in a way that makes the question easier
- counting non-zero-repeat schedules as success
- broad solver3/solver4 heuristic work unrelated to solver5 construction coverage
- webapp/product rewrites unrelated to registering solver5
- benchmark gaming via special-case result files instead of explicit constructor logic

## Constraints
- `solver5` should stay **pure-SGP only** for this session.
- A cell counts as solved only if the returned schedule is valid and canonical final score is zero.
- Prefer explicit constructor families and clean orchestration over opaque search fallback.
- Keep the benchmark fixed and honest.
- When a family only supports a frontier or lower-bound construction, prefixes are allowed: if a family constructs `g-p-W`, taking the first `w <= W` weeks is valid.
- Record promising but deferred families in `autoresearch.ideas.md`.

## Initial Portfolio Plan
High-ROI constructor order from the research note:
1. round robin / 1-factorization (`p=2`)
2. triples via KTS / NKTS (`p=3`)
3. dedicated `p=4` router (RBIBD / RGDD / URD-derived branches)
4. RTD / MOLS engine
5. recursive clique/group fill (`+G(t)` style lifting)
6. broader RBIBD / RGDD / RITD / URD / ownSG patches

## Current Baseline
- `solver5` exists as a new construction-first pure-SGP solver family.
- Initial shipped family: round robin / 1-factorization for `p=2`, including truncated prefixes.
- Coverage beyond `p=2` is currently expected to be zero until more families land.

## What's Been Tried
- Initial setup should establish the solver5 scaffold, validator, engine registration, benchmark harness, and the round-robin baseline.
- After baseline, the next live directions should be structural constructor families, not search-based cheating:
  - KTS / NKTS for `p=3`
  - dedicated `p=4` routing
  - prime / prime-power RTD-MOLS families
  - recursive lifting once base families exist
